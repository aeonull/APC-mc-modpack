## aeonull's guide to setting up Modded Minecraft

## Step 1: Update your Java!!
(pls do this)
https://www.java.com/en/download/

## Step 2: Install Forge Mod Loader
1. Go here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.19.2.html
2. Download Recommended (Installer)
3. Click the skip link in upper right hand corner, this should download a .jar file. Do not click any other links on this page!!
4. Run this .jar file. Use the installer to install for client. More than likely the default directory is what you want.
5. Open the Minecraft Launcher, and next to the PLAY button, select forge. Launch the game at least once and make sure it doesn't crash!

## Step 3: Find your mods folder.
1. On your desktop, use Ctrl + R or type 'Run' into the search bar
2. type %appdata% and hit enter
3. Look for .minecraft
(Consider making a shortcut to this folder! You will likely be coming back here.)
4. Open the mods folder! This is where you will add your mods in the next step.

## Step 4: Download the mods and put them in this mods folder


### Method 1 (the cool kids way):
Clone the GitHub repository into the mods folder we found earlier. This is the ideal setup, since you can update your folder from the repo at any time just by 'pulling' the Git repo!

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your computer: 
https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. open 'Command Prompt' (press windows key, type 'cmd', hit enter)
3. Run the below two commands:
```
cd %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
git clone https://github.com/aeonull/APC-mc-modpack .
```
4. If no errors, nice! You should now have updated the modpack in the cool kids way. This may or may not come back to reward you later.



### Method 2:
If you have issues with the above method or are simply uncool, here's a significantly simpler way:
1. Click the green Code button on the upper right hand corner of the page
2. Click download .zip
3. This will download all the mod files into a big zip file for you!
4. Unzip this file
5. Look inside the unzipped folder, move all the files from this folder into the mods folder we opened in step 3!

Final Step: Launch the game, hope it doesn't crash! You might consider adjusting your settings, adding performance mods like Optifine, or shaders to enhance your visuals. Happy gaming!
